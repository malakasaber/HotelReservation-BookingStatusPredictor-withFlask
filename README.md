# Hotel Booking Status Predictor 🏨

My first web deployment project! A machine learning-powered Flask application that predicts hotel booking cancellation status to help hotels optimize their reservation management.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project predicts whether a hotel booking will be canceled or confirmed based on various booking features like lead time, guest preferences, booking channels, and seasonal patterns.

**🌟 Why This Matters:**
- Hotels lose revenue from last-minute cancellations
- Helps with better room allocation and pricing strategies
- Enables proactive customer retention efforts

## ✨ Features

- **🤖 ML Prediction**: Intelligent booking status prediction
- **🌐 Web Interface**: User-friendly Flask web application  
- **📊 Real-time Results**: Instant prediction with confidence scores
- **📱 Responsive Design**: Works on all devices
- **🔍 Input Validation**: Comprehensive error handling

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub

*Note: This is my first deployment project - feedback welcome!*

## 🎮 How to Use

1. **run the web app**
2. **Fill in booking details**:
   - Lead time (days between booking and arrival)
   - Number of adults/children
   - Room type preferences
   - Special requests
   - Booking channel
   - Previous cancellations
3. **Click "Predict"** to get instant results
4. **View prediction** with confidence level

## 💻 Local Setup

Want to run this locally? Here's how:

### Prerequisites
```bash
Python 3.7+
pip
```

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hotel-booking-predictor.git
cd hotel-booking-predictor

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

## 🤖 Model Features

The ML model uses these booking characteristics:

**📅 Timing Features:**
- Lead time (booking to arrival days)
- Arrival month/year
- Length of stay

**👥 Guest Features:**
- Number of adults/children/babies
- Customer type
- Previous bookings history

**🏨 Booking Features:**
- Room type requested vs assigned
- Meal plan
- Market segment
- Distribution channel

**💰 Pricing Features:**
- Average daily rate
- Special requests count
- Deposit type

## 🎯 Key Insights

From the data analysis, I discovered:

- **Lead Time Impact**: Bookings made >30 days in advance have higher cancellation rates
- **Seasonal Patterns**: Summer months show different cancellation behaviors  
- **Customer Type**: Transient customers cancel more than contract customers
- **Room Changes**: Mismatched room assignments increase cancellation probability

## 📈 Future Improvements

As I continue learning, I plan to add:

- [ ] **Model Enhancement**: Try different algorithms (XGBoost, Neural Networks)
- [ ] **Feature Engineering**: Create more predictive features
- [ ] **API Development**: REST API for third-party integrations
- [ ] **Dashboard**: Analytics dashboard for hotel managers
- [ ] **Real-time Updates**: Live model retraining capabilities
- [ ] **Multi-hotel Support**: Extend to different hotel types

## 🎓 Learning Journey

**What I Learned:**
- First experience with Flask web framework
- Model deployment and web integration
- HTML/CSS for user interfaces
- Git version control and GitHub
- Web hosting and deployment process

**Challenges Overcome:**
- Handling different data types in web forms
- Model serialization and loading
- Responsive web design
- Deployment configuration

## 🐛 Known Issues

- [ ] Loading time could be optimized
- [ ] Mobile UI needs minor tweaks
- [ ] Error messages could be more descriptive

*I'm actively working on these improvements!*
